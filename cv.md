Also for the sake of testing code quoting functionality of Github markdown I want to share this example:  
```
<style>

      border-radius: 20px;
      width: 70%;
      height: 400px;
      margin:  50 auto;
      background: repeating-linear-gradient(
        45deg,
        yellow 0px,
        yellow 40px,
        black 50px,
        black 85px
      );
    }
    
</style>
  
  <div></div>
  ```
